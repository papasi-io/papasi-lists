# papasi lists
Repository that contains the allow and block lists for Blockcore Atomic Swaps hosts.

Based around the same ideas of [PhishFort Counter-Phishing Lists](https://github.com/phishfort/phishfort-lists).

The content of this repo is retrieved during build process of the apps that relies on it and embedded directly into the apps. That means the lists are not updated on-the-fly, but whenever they are updated in the app stores/web apps are re-deployed.
